## What problem are we trying to solve
This project was created to be a portfolio page for all of my work as a Web Developer. On this page there are links to different sections including About Me, my Work, and different options to Contact Me. In the About Me section I go over basic information about me and what I have accomplished. In the Work sections there are some clickable images which will navigate the user to some of the projects that I have worked on in the past. Under the Contact Me section there is my phone number, my email address, a navigatable link to my Github and a link to my Facebook page.

## Requirements
- Upon load, the user is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- When the navigation links are clicked then the user will be brought to the corresponding section
- When the link corresponding to the developers work is clicked then the user is presented a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- When the user is presented wit the developer's first application, then that application's image will appear larger in size than the others
- When the user clicks on the images of the applications then the user is sent to the deployed application
- When the page or view is resized then the webpage layout is shown to be responsive and adapts to viewport

## Notes
I believe that I did alright with this project excluding some elements of the page being placed awkwardly. I still need some time to get used to using flexbox as well as adjusting the elements on the page to fit the viewport. I plan on continuing work on this project until I can further my understanding.
